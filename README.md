Cyber Security Internship Task 1  
Vulnerability Assessment Report for a Live Website  
Part of Future Interns Cyber Security Internship Program


## Objective
To perform a vulnerability assessment on a live website, identify security risks, classify their severity, and provide clear remediation steps in a professional security report format.


## Tools Used
- OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan)
- Browser DevTools
- Kali Linux


## Task Scope
- Website reconnaissance
- Vulnerability scanning
- Risk classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Security analysis
- Professional documentation and reporting
All testing activities were strictly passive and non-intrusive.
No exploitation, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service attempts were performed.


## Deliverables
- Vulnerability Assessment Report (PDF/Word/Canva)
- Screenshots of scans and findings
- Documentation of tools and commands
- GitHub repository with complete structure


## Evidence
The screenshots included in the screenshots folder represent the findings identified
during the passive vulnerability assessment using OWASP ZAP.
Each image corresponds to a specific vulnerability and supports the observations
documented in the final assessment report.

## Target Website
OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally vulnerable web application designed for
security training and testing purposes. It was selected to safely practice
and document common web application security issues.
